### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sevi Rynn (She/They) and I'm making the switch to Software Engineering after a decade in IT! The 2023-2024 job market is really tough, so much so that even specilizations in asset management and linux platform engineering wasn't enough. 

I'm currently a student of Tech Elevator in their Java full stack code camp.
