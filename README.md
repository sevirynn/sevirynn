### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sevi Rynn (She/They) and I'm a Network Administrator who likes to work on a little bit of everything! My delve into development started in 2015 in a Starbucks next to the crappy call center I worked in. My evenings were spent working through Codecademy coursees while waiting for my then partner's staggered shift to end. In early 2024 I formally took learning to code to the next level by enrolling into the Tech Elevator Java Bootcamp. These I mostly fuss with Python and BASH scripting which fits nicely with the whole Linux and Networking nerd thing.
